## Sample Challenge Concepts

Some ideas to explore, and you can combine ideas for your project: 

* Data Visualization / Dashboard for Coronavirus - create a tool to help decision-makers manage information
* Predictive Modeling / Forecasting of Coronavirus Epidemic - use various models and algorithms to predict the future spread of the disease (ideas: SEIR, time-series, regression models, VAR, etc.)
* Language Processing / Topic Modeling of News (e.g. detect fake news, understand sentiment, what topics resonate with the coronavirus)
* Flight path / Network modeling of Epidemic - correlate spread of the disease with flight patterns
